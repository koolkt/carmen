    tAboutHouseGBP: "Where the composer wrote and orchestrated his best known work, Carmen, in 1874. Staged in 1875 at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, three months before the composer's death, Carmen became one of the most famous operas represented in the world. Periodically opened to the public since 2010, Georges Bizet's house invites visitors to a real dive in a timeless atmosphere that gives a precise idea of the places where life and creation took place in the romantic era. Bizet was also very close to Pauline Viardot, of whom he was a neighbour, both in Paris and Bougival, and who ardently defended Carmen's score since composer’s death. Like Brahms, and a few years later, Tchaikovsky, Nietzsche and Mahler, she contributed to the recognition of Carmen as one of the greatest masterpieces of lyric art.",
    tAboutFrenesH: 'The Frênes Domain',
    tAboutFrenesP: "Charmed by the magic of these places, Jorge Chaminé, baritone and recognized pedagogue, founder of the Amis de Georges Bizet has organized, since 2000, a series of public master classes, here, where the houses of Pauline Viardot and Ivan Turgenev stand. In 2008 he created a festival and in that same year invited the great Spanish mezzo-soprano Teresa Berganza for annual master classes, enabling young singers, at the beginning of their careers, to benefit from the teaching of this immense singer. In the 80's, Berganza, unparalleled Mozart's and Rossini's interpreter, also played the title role of Carmen in a legendary performance, alongside Plácido Domingo, under the direction of Claudio Abbado.",
    tAboutViardotH: 'The Villa Viardot',
    tAboutViardotP: "Where Pauline Viardot lived (1821-1910). She was an illustrious singer, interpreter of the operas of Rossini, Berlioz, Meyerbeer and Gounod, sister of La Malibran and a great figure in the cultural life of the time. A rich and charismatic personality, Pauline Viardot went through the entire 19th century (she knew both Da Ponte - Mozart's librettist - and Stravinsky!) and led a prestigious career around the world. Woman of letters and culture, a talented composer, she hosted the most fashionable salons at her home in Paris, Bougival and Baden-Baden, where she entertained artists and intellectuals from all over Europe. A friend of Liszt, George Sand and Turgenev, among others, she regularly stayed in Bougival, in this delightful madness of the Directoire style, built in 1830.",

    tAboutCEMH: 'CEM Project (European Centre of Music)',
    tAboutCEMP: "Threatened for many years, the site is today at the heart of an ambitious and multidisciplinary cultural project designed by Jorge Chaminé: the European Centre of Music (CEM) at Bougival, project that the baritone stands up for and has passionately carried out for ten years and which is scheduled to open in 2022. Project created and led for 17 years by Jorge Chaminé president of the CEM in English. Integrated in a landscaped park specially remodeled for the occasion, the houses of Bizet, Pauline Viardot, Tourgueniev and Berthe Morisot will be the pillars of the new cultural area of the town Bougival: The European Music Centre (CEM), a living, modern, forward-looking place that embodies the humanist values that symbolize European culture. Anchored in one of the most productive artistic periods in art history, the CEM will be both a heritage site celebrating artists of the romantic era and a musical academy welcoming young artists in education period. It will open its doors to the public, by means of a quality program (concerts, conferences, public master classes ...). Another purpose is for the CEM to become, from the very day of its inauguration, a reference place of transdisciplinary study on 19th century music, thus open to other academic fields (literature, visual arts, history, philosophy, theater…). As a place of passing on knowledge, residence and exchange, the CEM has also the potential to become a centre of research on neurosciences and more specifically on the links between music and brain. Regular invitations are thus foreseen so that neuroscientists might work especially on the particularly powerful driving role that music can play in the assimilation of general knowledge and in the treatment of certain pathologies, autism in particular.",
